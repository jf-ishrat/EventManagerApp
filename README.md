# EventManagerApp
Android project(using Firebase)

This is for managing volunteers for University events like techfest, carnival etc where admin can create an event and can add essential sectors(Food sector, hackathon sector etc)
for which volunteers are needed. Whereas others who want to work as a volunteer can join the event and then join the sector by using a secret code(secret code will be created by the admin).
